# Python-Maze-Solver
Solves maze images using graph expansion and depth first search, this idea was inspired by https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving, but i made the implementation myself, P.S i also copied some of his maze examples just so i can test it, it is in the Maze_Img folder. Do bear in mind this program have not been tested yet with other types of mazes, other than what's included here, you could however fork it and add new fetures to it though (much appreciated).
